.TH _PRINTF 3 "09 July 2022" "man_3_printf page"

.SH NAME
_printf - a replicate of the standard printf function

.SH SYNOPSIS
 #include "main.h"
 int _printf([OPTIONS][ARGUMENTS],...);
 int _printf(const char *string, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The function _printf() produces output according to a format as described on
this man page. It will write output to stdout,the standard output stream.

.SH CONVERSION SPECIFIERS

.B c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char,
and the resulting character is written.

.B s
the const char * argument is expected to be a pointer
to an array of character type (pointer to a string).
Characters from the array are written up to (but not including)
a terminating null byte ('\0'); if a precision is specified,
no more than the number specified are written. If a precision is given, no
null byte need be present; if the precision is not
specified, or is greater than the size of the array, the
array must contain a terminating null byte.

.B %
A '%' is written. No argument is converted. The complete
conversion specification is '%%'.

.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits
that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer
digits, it is padded on the left with zeros. The default
precision is 1. When 0 is printed with an explicit
precision 0,the output is empty.

.SH RETURN VALUE
When succesful, _printf() will return the number of characters printed and
display on the screen.
If an error is encountered, such as incorrect format or no character input,
the return will be -1

.SH EXAMPLE
To print your name and the current year
#include "main.h"
_printf(" My name is %s, and we are in %d\\n", name, year);
